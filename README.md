# Mobile-Phone-Clustering
Utilize PCA, K-Means, Data Preprocessing, and Data Visualization to cluster mobile phones based on their most important components
Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: remove columns with non integer or float data type and check the dataset for null values
2. PCA: Choosing the variables with the most influences to simplify the dataset for further process
3. Clustering: Using K-means to divide the mobile phones into three clusters based on their most crucial component
4. Data Visualization: Used in all steps above (boxplot for removing outliers in step 1, bar graph for PCA in step 2, and line graph and cluster plot in step 3
5. Result: The dataset was divided into three clusters based on the most important components, which are number of processors and screen sizes
